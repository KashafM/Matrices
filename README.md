# Matrices
In this program, various properties of matrices are used to solve various mathematical and physics problems. 
In the first and second section, the inverse, determinate and transpose of given matrices are computed as well as extracting specific rows. 
In the final section, a physics pulley problem is evaluated using matrix properties to solve for the unknown values in a given matrix relaying the force of the pulleys.
